# GoogleRSS-NewsCrawler
GoogleRSS-NewsCrawler is a Python tool that enables you to scrape news articles from Google RSS feeds. With this tool, you can extract and store relevant data from various news sources such as the article's title, publisher, publication date, URL, content, and keywords. We also use natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information from the text, such as digits with context. The tool then exports the extracted data to a CSV file, making it easy for you to use and analyze the data.
